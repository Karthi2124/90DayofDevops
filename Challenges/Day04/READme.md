## What is Kernel?
The kernel is the core component of an operating system (OS). It acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software, managing system resources and allowing software applications to communicate with hardware components like the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

## Key Functions of a Kernel
### 1.Process Management:
Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
Ensures efficient CPU usage by allocating time and resources to processes.
### 2. Memory Management:
Manages the system’s RAM and ensures processes have access to memory.
Handles virtual memory and paging, ensuring efficient use of physical memory.

### 3. Device Management:
Provides a standardized interface for software to interact with hardware devices.
Manages input/output operations with drivers.

### 4. File System Management:
Manages data storage and retrieval on disks using file systems.
Provides access permissions and handles file operations like reading and writing.

### 5. Security and Access Control:
Implements user authentication and access permissions to ensure system security.
Manages user and process isolation.

## What is Shell Scripting in DevOps?
Shell scripting is writing a series of commands in a file (called a script) to automate tasks that would otherwise require manual execution. It’s extensively used in DevOps for automating repetitive tasks, managing system configurations, deploying applications, and maintaining servers.

### Example:
A shell script to automate the backup of a directory:

#!/bin/bash
#Backup Script
SOURCE="/home/user/documents"
DESTINATION="/home/user/backup"

## What is #!/bin/bash? Can we write #!/bin/sh as well?
#!/bin/bash: This is called a shebang. It tells the system to execute the script using the bash shell. bash is an advanced shell offering features like arrays, functions, and extended syntax.
#!/bin/sh: This specifies the use of the sh shell, which is a more basic shell with fewer features compared to bash.
Can we use #!/bin/sh?
Yes, but scripts written for bash may not work in sh if they use bash-specific features.

### Example:
#!/bin/bash
echo "This script uses bash"

vs.

#!/bin/sh
echo "This script uses sh"
