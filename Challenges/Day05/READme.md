# Day 5 Task: Advanced Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers with User Management
## 1.Create Directories Using Shell Script:

Creating directories using a shell script involves writing a script in a text file and executing it in the terminal. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how to create directories using a shell script:

#### 1. Understand the mkdir Command
mkdir (make directory) is a Linux/Unix command used to create directories.
Syntax: mkdir [options] directory_name
#### 2. Create a Shell Script
Shell scripts are text files containing commands executed by the shell interpreter.
File extensions for shell scripts are typically .sh.
#### 3. Steps to Create and Execute the Script
Step 1: Open a Terminal
Launch your terminal on Linux/Unix or a similar environment (like WSL on Windows).
Step 2: Create a Script File
Use a text editor (e.g., nano, vim, or touch) to create a file.
bash
Copy code
nano create_directories.sh
Step 3: Write the Script
Add the following content to the script file:
bash


## 2. Create a Script to Backup All Your Work:
#### Script Overview
The script will:
* Backup all files in a source directory.
* Save the backup to a destination directory.
* Add a timestamp to the backup file.
* Optionally clean old backups (e.g., older than 7 days).

## 3. Cron and Crontab to Automate the Backup Script:
* Cron: A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. It automates repetitive tasks by running commands or scripts at specified times and intervals.
* Crontab: Short for "cron table," it is a configuration file where you define the tasks (called "cron jobs") and their schedules.
### Use of Cron and Crontab
Cron and Crontab are primarily used to automate routine and repetitive tasks, which saves time and ensures tasks run consistently. Here are some common uses:

## 4. User Management:
User management is a critical part of Linux system administration, as it allows for the control and organization of system users, their permissions, and their environments.
